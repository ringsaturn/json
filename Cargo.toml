# This is our Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
#
# Please do not bump this unnecessarily.
# Changing this should bump the minor version for semver (2.x for semver).
#
# The first version of Cargo that supports this field was in Rust 1.56.0.
# In older releases, the field will be ignored, and Cargo will display a warning.
